This repository contains all code and data related to the exam paper: __Decision Making in ADHD: Fitting the ORL Model to a New Task and Data__

## Assignment description
The purpose of this paper is to investigate decision making in relation to ADHD in an aim to elucidate cognitive processes underlying suboptimal or impaired decision making of individuals with ADHD. The ORL cognitive model (Haines et al. (2021)) of decision making on the iowa gambling task is modified to fit a two-armed exploration/exploitation task (Horvath et al. (2021)).

## Usage
Single subject recovery and simulations of the modified model is found in the exex_ORL files and group-level hiearachical simulations, recovery and estimations are found in the exex_ORL_hier files. 
Model agents are found in the txt-files and simulations in the R-files. Recovery and estimations are found in the Rmd-files and data wrangling and preprocessing are found in the notes.Rmd.

## Results
We succesfully fitted the modified model, but performance was suboptimal. Parameter respecification and fitting is necessary for optimal performance.
